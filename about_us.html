<h3>Why did your group decide to do this project?</h3>
<p>____</p>
<p>For Sofia Benitez, an undocumented student living in Arizona, education has been more than a step to a better life.</p>
<br/>

<p>“I’ve always felt that education was the driving force for me, especially as an undocumented immigrant I really needed motivation to get past the obstacles”. Sofia is a dreamer. Sofia is a fighter. Sofia is an STEM graduate, with a degree in physics. She graduated in 2012 and is taking one master level class per semester, because she can’t afford to enroll in the full-time program.</p>
<br/>

<p>In contrast with the 39 percent of students in public universities who receive federal grants to fund their education, dreamers like Sofia are ineligible for financial aid programs. In Arizona, they are also ineligible for instate rates even though there’s no other state they can call home. Not only are they battling to have access to affordable higher education, but getting driver’s licences and having their families shielded from deportation is also a pressing issue.</p>
<br/>

<p>“I feel like I came to this country for the freedom and yet I feel trapped”, she said over the phone as she trailed around Madera Canyon in Tucson, in awe of the foliage, the birds, and the immensity of nature.</p>
<br/>

<p>Sofia “came out” as undocumented two weeks. Her story is important, and she wants to fight for education equity in Arizona so other undocumented students on putting their future in their education can have hope.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Para Sofia Benitez, estudiante indocumentada de Arizona, la educación es más que una herramienta para un mejor futuro.</p>
<br/> 

<p>“Siempre he sentido que la educación es una herramienta que me impulsa y me motiva para sobrellevar los obstáculos, especialmente siendo indocumentada”, dijo. 
Sofía es una soñadora. Sofía es una luchadora. Sofía se graduó con un título en física en el 2012 y ahora toma una clase de maestria por semestre, ya que no puede pagar por participar en el programa a tiempo completo.  
A diferencia del 39 por ciento de los estudiantes en el país que reciben subsidios federales, los dreamers no califican para programas de ayuda financiera. Y en Arizona, se les niega matrícula como residentes del estado, a pesar de que no hay ningún otro lugar que consideren su hogar.</p>
<br/>

<p>En este estado se puede decir que los dreamers han luchado, y siguen en la batalla, por licencias de conducir, acceso a colegiaturas como residentes y por protecciones de deportación para sus familiares.</p>
<br/>

<p>“Siento que llegue a este país por la libertad y aún así me siento atrapada”, dijo Sofía en una entrevista telefónica, mientras paseaba por el parque natural Madera Canyon en Tucson, Arizona. Contó que le impresiona la naturaleza, los pájaros y la inmensidad del paisaje. Lo que dice le da fuerzas para seguir en la lucha por acceso a una educación superior.</p> 
<br/>
<p>Recientemente, salió de las sombras para declarar abiertamente y sin el temor natural de los inmigrantes, que es indocumentada. La historia de Sofía es el reflejo de miles de estudiantes indocumentados que como ella tratan de mantener las esperanzas vivas para continuar el camino de la vida a través de triunfos en la educación. </p>

<p>“I’ve always felt that education was the driving force for me, especially as an undocumented immigrant I really needed motivation to get past the obstacles. It would be . they don’t have hope. graduate in may 2012 -- tried to take one physics graduate class. I want to go to graduate school, but most grad students work at the school and that’s how they . tried to make that commitment. I feel like i came to this country for the freedom and yet i feel trapped. any little chance i get to know this state more -- being out in nature reminds me that all the other problems that people put on you don’t matter. Green Valley to Madera Canyon-- so many birds, it’s great. foliage everywhere there’s so many birds. -- makes me feel like to -- 2 weeks ago, less than ago.</p>
